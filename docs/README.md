# "One Ruble Per Drone" — Engineering Plan Index

> Working title. A bright 16-bit retro game with a grim, satirical premise: you man
> a machine-gun post atop a Moscow skyscraper, shoot down drones for **1 ruble each**,
> and fight your own body (sleep, 💩, hunger, thirst, the need to smoke or drink)
> while the building's residents sell you comfort — or extract favors when you're
> broke. Endless shift, pinball-style scoring, browser/TypeScript.

This folder is the complete implementation plan. Each area below is a self-contained
task an engineer can pick up cold. **Read the two foundation docs first**, then your
area doc.

## Foundation docs (read first)

| Doc | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`game-design.md`](game-design.md) | Game Design Document — premise, tone, the five need meters (incl. 💩), economy of services & favors, random incidents, pinball scoring, failure/game-over, persistence. |
| [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | Tech stack (TypeScript + Vite + Canvas 2D + Vitest), project structure, the shared `GameState`/event-bus/scene contracts, the **testing strategy (all tests must pass)**, ownership rules, and the area-doc template every area below follows. |
| [`compliance.md`](compliance.md) | **Mandatory** respect & anti-stereotype policy — who we may mock (the regime/war/military-institution) and who we must never ridicule (ordinary Russian people). |
| [`testing.md`](testing.md) | **Mandatory** test strategy & quality gates — built **by AI**, so the gates are un-gameable and CI-enforced (coverage on lines/branches/functions, mutation testing, determinism golden, no focused/skipped tests, independent review). Supersedes `architecture.md §7`. |
| [`compatibility.md`](compatibility.md) | **Mandatory** cross-browser & mobile spec — support matrix (evergreen + iOS Safari 15.4+), the touch control scheme (touch-to-aim, hold to fire), iOS-Safari requirements (audio unlock, viewport, storage), and the required Playwright matrix. |

## Dependency & suggested build order

Everything depends on **Core (00)**; **Art (11)** ships placeholder art early so no
one is blocked on final pixels.

```
Phase 1 (foundation):      00 Core Platform   +   11 Art (placeholders)   +   09 State & Persistence
Phase 2 (gameplay logic):  02 Meters → 03 Economy, 04 Scoring, 05 Incidents   (parallel; share Core + events)
Phase 3 (the game):        01 Gameplay Engine   (consumes Meters/Incidents flags, emits combat/score events)
Phase 4 (presentation):    10 HUD/UI   +   06 Audio   (both react to GameState + events)
Phase 5 (shell):           07 Main Menu   +   08 Highscores   +   12 Credits   (need SceneManager + Persistence + Art)
```

Within a phase, areas can be built in parallel because they integrate only through
the shared contracts in `architecture.md` (§4 `GameState` slices, §5 event bus, §6
scenes) — never by importing each other's internals.

## Hard rules for every area (from `architecture.md`)

1. **Pure, deterministic logic.** No `Math.random()` (use the seeded RNG); no real
   clock in logic (time is injected as `dt`). This is what makes the game testable.
2. **Side effects at the edges.** Logic must not import rendering/audio/DOM/storage.
3. **Integrate via contracts only** — the `GameState` slice your area owns and the
   typed event bus. Don't reach into another area's modules.
4. **Data-driven content** lives in `src/content/`, not buried in system code.
5. **Tests are mandatory and CI-enforced.** Built by AI → gates are un-gameable (see
   [`testing.md`](testing.md)). Each area lists its required tests as a *minimum*. An
   area is not done until **CI** is green: `npm run check`
   (`tsc --noEmit && eslint . && vitest run`), the Playwright cross-browser matrix,
   the content-lint, and (logic areas) the mutation run — with logic coverage ≥ 85%
   on lines/branches/functions and an independent reviewer's sign-off.
6. **Respect & compliance.** Obey [`compliance.md`](compliance.md): satire targets the
   regime/war/military-institution, never ordinary Russian people or ethnic
   stereotypes. All player-facing copy, names, art, and audio must comply (enforced by
   content-lint + independent review).
7. **Cross-browser & mobile.** Obey [`compatibility.md`](compatibility.md): the game
   is a first-class **mobile** target (iOS Safari 15.4+). Input is touch-to-aim /
   hold-to-fire via Pointer Events; rendering, audio, and storage honor the Safari
   requirements; the Playwright WebKit + mobile suite must pass.

## Definition of done (per area)

See `architecture.md §9` (and `testing.md`, `compatibility.md`). In short: matches the
GDD + its area doc, honors the shared contracts, required tests authored **and passing
in CI** (incl. the cross-browser matrix where applicable), no gate-gaming shortcuts,
clean lint/types, a short public-API note, and an independent reviewer's sign-off.
Tone check: keep all player-facing copy relentlessly cheerful over the grim subject
matter (GDD §2).
