# Technical Architecture & Engineering Contract

> Status: **Foundation doc (authored by lead).** This defines the tech stack,
> project structure, the shared contracts that let independent areas integrate, the
> testing strategy every area must satisfy, and the template every area task
> follows. Read `docs/game-design.md` and `docs/compliance.md` first.

## 1. Tech stack

- **Language:** TypeScript, `strict: true`. No implicit `any`.
- **Build/dev:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (ES modules, fast HMR, static build).
- **Rendering:** **Canvas 2D** at a fixed internal resolution, integer-scaled to the
  viewport with `image-rendering: pixelated`. No game framework by default (keeps
  logic testable and dependency-light). Internal resolution: **384×216** (16:9).
- **Audio:** Web Audio API (see Audio area).
- **Tests:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (+ `jsdom` environment for DOM/canvas-
  touching tests). Optional Playwright smoke test for the booted app.
- **Lint/format:** ESLint + Prettier. **Typecheck:** `tsc --noEmit`.
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` via a wrapped, injectable storage module.

No backend. Everything runs client-side and ships as static files.

## 2. Project structure

```
/
  index.html
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  vite.config.ts
  vitest.config.ts
  .eslintrc.cjs / eslint.config.js
  /src
    main.ts            # bootstrap: canvas, input, audio unlock, game loop driver
    /core              # loop, fixed timestep, seedable RNG, clock, event bus, math, ECS registry
    /state             # app state machine (scenes) + shared GameState type
    /systems           # pure-ish update systems: spawning, shooting, meters, economy, scoring, incidents, difficulty
    /entities          # entity/component shapes: drones, projectiles, pickups
    /render            # renderers, sprite atlas, camera/scaler, HUD draw, background/parallax
    /audio             # audio engine, music director, sfx bank
    /ui                # menus, settings, highscore entry/list views, dialog/toast
    /persistence       # storage wrapper, highscores repo, settings repo, migrations
    /content           # DATA: drone types, resident roster, incident catalog, balance tables
    /assets            # sprites, audio, fonts
    /types             # cross-cutting shared types
  /tests               # integration tests (unit tests may co-locate as *.test.ts)
  /docs                # planning docs (this folder)
```

Co-locate unit tests as `foo.test.ts` next to `foo.ts`. Cross-area integration
tests live in `/tests`.

## 3. Architectural principles (these make the game testable)

1. **Pure logic, side effects at the edges.** All gameplay rules are pure functions
   over state: `update(slice, dt, ctx) -> newSlice` (or mutate-in-place on a plain
   data `GameState` — pick one convention per area and document it). Rendering,
   audio, DOM, and storage are side-effecting modules invoked *outside* the logic.
   Logic modules must not import rendering/audio/DOM.
2. **Deterministic & seedable.** No `Math.random()` in logic. Use the injected
   seedable PRNG from `core/rng`. Same seed + same inputs ⇒ identical run. This is
   what makes gameplay testable.
3. **Time is injected.** No `Date.now()` / `performance.now()` inside logic. Systems
   receive `dt` (seconds). Only `main.ts`'s loop driver reads the real clock. Tests
   advance time by calling `update` with chosen `dt`.
4. **Fixed-timestep update, interpolated render.** Logic updates at a fixed 60 Hz
   accumulator; rendering interpolates. Deterministic regardless of frame rate.
5. **Decoupled via a typed event bus.** Systems emit/observe typed events (§5) so
   audio, scoring, and HUD can react to e.g. `droneDestroyed` without hard coupling.
6. **Data-driven content.** Drone stats, resident tables, incident definitions, and
   balance curves live in `src/content/` as typed data, not buried in logic. Tuning
   must not require touching system code.

## 4. Core shared types (the `GameState`)

`GameState` is a plain object composed of **slices**, one per gameplay area. Each
area owns its slice's shape and its update function. The skeleton (areas refine
their own slice; do not change another area's slice without coordination):

```ts
// src/state/game-state.ts  (skeleton — owned collectively, changes via lead)
export interface GameState {
  time: { shiftSeconds: number; phase: 'day' | 'night'; difficulty: number };
  player: { rubles: number; debt: number; reputation: number };
  meters: MetersState;        // Meters area
  combat: CombatState;        // Gameplay Engine area (drones, projectiles, aim, postIntegrity)
  scoring: ScoringState;      // Scoring area
  economy: EconomyState;      // Economy & Residents area
  incidents: IncidentsState;  // Random Incidents area
  rng: RngState;              // core/rng
  flags: Record<string, boolean>;
}
```

`ctx` passed to systems provides injected capabilities:

```ts
export interface SystemContext {
  rng: Rng;            // core/rng — seedable
  events: EventBus;    // core/events
  content: Content;    // loaded src/content data tables
}
```

## 5. The event bus contract

`core/events` exposes a typed emitter. Event names + payloads are a **shared
contract**; adding an event is fine, changing an existing payload requires lead
sign-off. Baseline events (areas extend this map):

```ts
export interface GameEvents {
  droneSpawned:   { id: number; kind: string };
  droneDestroyed: { id: number; kind: string; byPlayer: boolean; pos: Vec2 };
  droneEscaped:   { id: number; damage: number };          // hit the building
  shotFired:      { from: Vec2; angle: number };
  rublesChanged:  { delta: number; total: number };
  meterCrisis:    { meter: MeterKey; entered: boolean };
  serviceBought:  { residentId: string; service: string; cost: number };
  favorBegged:    { residentId: string; favor: string; consequence: string };
  incidentStart:  { id: string };
  incidentEnd:    { id: string };
  scoreChanged:   { delta: number; total: number; reason: string };
  comboChanged:   { multiplier: number };
  gameOver:       { score: number; cause: string };
}
```

## 6. App state machine (scenes)

`state/` owns a finite state machine over scenes:

```
Boot → MainMenu → Playing ⇄ Paused
                    Playing → GameOver → (HighscoreEntry?) → Highscores → MainMenu
MainMenu → Settings → MainMenu
MainMenu → Highscores → MainMenu
MainMenu → Credits → MainMenu        (and optionally GameOver/Highscores → Credits)
```

Each scene implements `{ enter(), update(dt, ctx), render(r), exit(), onInput(e) }`.
The Gameplay Engine owns the `Playing` scene; UI areas own menu/highscore/settings
scenes. The lead owns the `SceneManager` skeleton in `state/`.

## 7. Testing strategy (mandatory for every area)

Every area task **must** ship automated tests, and **all tests must pass** (`npm
test` green, `tsc --noEmit` clean, lint clean) before the area is "done." Specifics:

- **Unit tests (Vitest):** cover the area's pure logic — meter drain curves, scoring
  math, spawn schedules at given seeds, economy transitions, incident triggers.
  Deterministic via seeded RNG and injected `dt`.
- **Integration tests (Vitest):** cross-area behavior through the event bus and
  `GameState` (e.g. "destroying a drone adds 1 ruble *and* emits `scoreChanged`").
- **DOM/canvas tests:** under `jsdom`; assert HUD/menus render expected text/state
  and that storage round-trips. Use a fake/in-memory storage in tests.
- **Coverage:** logic modules (`systems/`, `content/` validators, scoring, meters,
  economy) target **≥ 85% line coverage**. Rendering/audio may be lower but must
  have at least smoke tests.
- **No flakiness:** tests must not depend on wall-clock, real timers, real audio
  hardware, or `Math.random()`. Mock the Web Audio and Storage interfaces.
- **CI gate:** `npm run check` = `tsc --noEmit && eslint . && vitest run`. Areas are
  not complete until this is green.

Each area task lists its **required tests** explicitly. Treat that list as a minimum.

## 8. Integration & ownership rules

- An area may freely change files inside its own directory/slice.
- Shared skeletons (`state/game-state.ts`, `core/events.ts`, `state/scene-manager`,
  `core/rng`, `persistence` interface) are **lead-owned**; propose changes via PR
  tagged for lead review.
- Communicate cross-area needs through events and the `GameState` slice contract —
  never reach into another area's internal modules.
- Content tables in `src/content/` are shared data; each area owns the tables for
  its domain (e.g. Economy owns residents, Incidents owns the incident catalog).

## 9. Definition of done (applies to every area)

An area is complete when:

1. Its functionality matches the requirements in its task doc and the GDD.
2. Public interfaces match the contracts in this doc (or changes were approved).
3. Required automated tests are authored **and pass**; `npm run check` is green.
4. No `console` spam, no `any` without a written justification, no dead code.
5. A short README section (or doc update) documents the area's public API and data
   tables.
6. All player-facing copy, names, art, and audio comply with `docs/compliance.md`
   (respect & anti-stereotype policy).

## 10. Area task document template

Every file in `docs/areas/` MUST follow this structure so engineers can pick one up
cold:

## 1. Purpose
One paragraph: what this area is responsible for.

## 2. Scope
### In scope

### Out of scope (owned elsewhere)
- ...

## 3. Requirements & mechanics
Detailed, numbered functional requirements derived from the GDD.

## 4. Public interface (TypeScript)
The types, functions, slice shape, and events this area exposes/consumes.

## 5. Data / content tables
Any `src/content/` data this area defines, with shapes and example rows.
